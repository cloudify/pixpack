Hi, this is a collection of sources by me, most of them are only simple tests
so nothing is a "complete" effect...
I have no more time to code or go on, so I've released all to help someone
with my work.
Most of the C/C++ sources must be compiled with BCC 3.0+, for the other (the
oldest) I've used MSC 5.0+... For the ASM sources I recomend you TASM 3.0+.
For any greeting/question you can contact me via e-mail:

 fferoldi@mbox.vol.it
 federico@logicom.it
 2:331/223.15@fidonet.org

or in IRC in #demo-ita channel...

Good luck & have fun! :)

 Federico 'pix' Feroldi
